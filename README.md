# Introduction

Onion Pirate Radio is a simple project with the goal of creating a streaming radio station over the Tor network.

The instructions found here are just what I am using for my own setup. Feel free to experiment with your own settings and try out other applications. My goal here is simplicity and anonymity.

# Requirements for this project.

* [icecast](https://icecast.org/) - Streaming Audio Server.
* [ezstream](https://icecast.org/ezstream/) - Audio generator that feeds to icecast.
